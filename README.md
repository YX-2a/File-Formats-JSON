# File-Formats-JSON
This repo has one json file containing most file formats that i could have added.

# Rules :
Before comitting a change here are on some ground rules:

1.The Format Should Be : {"file_Extension" : "file_type"}.

2.Never ever say "File" when writing "file_type" as it is ambiguous. 

3.Capitalize every first letter in each word when writing "file_type" (Pascal Case).

4.If a file type has multiple extentions, you can write them in seperate JSON objects inside the array.
